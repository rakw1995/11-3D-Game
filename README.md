# Graveyard Smash
* This repository is Graveyard Smash, a 3d game I have made in Godot.

* Graveyard Smash is a vaporwave & 80s inspired miniature adventure in which you play as a young witch trapped in a graveyard at night. Your goal is to fight off the creatures who haunt the night with your magic.
